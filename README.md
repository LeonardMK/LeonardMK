Hey I am Leonard,
I don't know whether people read this, however, I am using this repository mainly for private projects.
Topics I can talk about all day are
- Statistics.
- Causal Inference.
- Science Fiction (Are there people on Github wo don't?)
- Machine Learning (See note above)
If you don't belive me I would say you can ask my next of kin but I am sure they wouldn't like me to give away there contats here.
